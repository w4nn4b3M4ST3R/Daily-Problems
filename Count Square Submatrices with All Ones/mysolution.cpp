/*
- Traverse each cell in the matrix; if it's 1, check its top, left, and top-left neighbors.

- Use min(top, left, top-left) + 1 to compute the largest square ending at that cell.

- Add the computed value to the total count (each value represents how many squares end there).

- Optimize space by using a single row buffer and a prev variable to track diagonal values.

- If any neighbor is 0, the square can't growâ€”reset the current cell's value to 1.
